# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. Before contributing to this project, please read carefully the following guidelines.

## License

This project is released under the **GNU General Public License (GPL)**.

By submitting a contribution, you agree to license your work under the **same GPL license** as the rest of the project.

## Copyright

- Each contributor retains the copyright on their own contributions.
- You must be the author of the submitted work or have the right to submit it.

No copyright assignment is required.

## Sign-off (Developer Certificate of Origin)

All contributions must be **signed off**.  By adding a sign-off to your commits, you certify that your contribution is made under the terms of the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/).

**Non-signed commits will be rejected.**

### How to sign-off a commit

Use the `-s` option when committing:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Brief description of the change"
```

This will add the following line to the commit message:
```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

You can set up Git to always sign-off with 

```bash
git config --global format.signoff true
```

This command is local to the project, so you shouldn't worry.

### Use of AI Tools

The Developer’s Certificate of Origin requires contributors to know the origin of their contributions and to have the right to submit them under the project’s license. At this time, it is not always clear that this requirement can be fully met when significant parts of a contribution are generated using AI tools.

AI-generated content can also be unreliable. AI tools may produce incorrect or low-quality code, misleading commit messages, documentation, or other output, even when errors are pointed out.

For these reasons, **contributions that appear to be generated by AI will be rejected.** This includes content that is overly formal or verbose, lacks clarity, appears correct on the surface but does not make sense, or that the contributor does not understand or cannot explain.

AI tools should be used carefully and responsibly.

Contributors are encouraged to use AI as a support tool rather than as a replacement for their own work. For example, AI can be useful for guidance, debugging, reviewing code for obvious mistakes, or checking consistency with project style, guidelines, and feedback before submitting a contribution.

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your contribution (`git checkout -b my-contribution-s.
3. Commit your changes **with the sign-off**.
4. Push your branch to your fork.
5. Create a pull request.

If it's your first contribution, please add yourself to the AUTHORS file following the format of the other entries, using the following commit message:
```
contributors: add @username to AUTHORS
```

### Commit message format
This project's commit message convention is based on the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. 

The commit message *MUST* be structured as follows:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

Where:

- **type**: The type of change being made. The following types are allowed:
  - `feat`: A new feature
  - `fix`: A bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation only changes
  - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
  - `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - `perf`: A code change that improves performance
  - `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
  - `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
  - `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
  - `revert`: Reverts a previous commit
  - `contributors`: Changes to the AUTHORS file
  - `ci`: Changes that involve continous integration
  - `misc`: Miscellaneous changes (fallback, use with caution)

- **scope**: The scope of the change. This is optional and can be used to specify the part of the project or the specific feature that is affected by the change.

- **description**: A brief description of the change. It must be written using imperative present tense.

### Examples

```
feat: add new feature
fix(ui): fix bug in the UI
docs: update README
style: format code
refactor: improve code structure
perf: improve performance
test: add missing tests
build: update build system
