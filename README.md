## TODOs
Since it's a pre-alpha product, there are quite a lot of things to be done:

_Common_

- [ ] GUI with QT6

_Logic circuits_

- [ ] Multiplexers & demultiplexers
- [ ] Timed simulation
- [ ] Flip flops & synchronous components
- [ ] Wires-to-bus & bus-to-wires
- [ ] INPUTS & OUTPUTS!!!!
- [ ] Bus display
- [ ] 7-segment display

_FSMs_
